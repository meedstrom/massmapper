Beware that it will also match a few obscure named function keys,

ns- part.  To guard this, use `massmapper--modifier-safe-re'

Benefit: it will always match if there's at least one modifier,
and not count spurious modifier-looking things such as
<ns-drag-n-drop> which contains an \"s-\".

Drawback: you can't match twice on the same string.  Look at the
case of M-s-<down>: it'll match M-, but if the search continues
from there, it will fail to match s- since it's only looking for
s- preceded by a dash (i.e. \"-s-\"), and our second search
starts past the first dash.  However, it's fine if you cut the
string and start a new search on the cut string.")
