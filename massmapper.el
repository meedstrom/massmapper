;;; Commentary:

;; Setup may go like this:

;; (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'massmapper-mode)
;; (add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-ctl)
;; (add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-homogenize -50))

(require 'massmapper-lib)
(require 'dash)
(require 'compat)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'help-fns) ;; help-fns-find-keymap-name
(require 'map) ;; map-let

;; REVIEW: Verify that command remappings apply

;; TODO: What to do about C-c C-x p  (org-set-property)?
;;       Because there is also C-c x p which copies to C-c C-x C-p.
;;       Maybe the user should be alerted to bastard sequences.

;; TODO: Promote error signals, which currently get demoted to a "Error during
;;       redisplay" message (because of where we put the hook)

;; TODO: Test binding keyboard macros and lambdas, and see if they get copied.
;;       I don't never bind either, so it's worth a look.
;;       https://www.gnu.org/software//emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Lookup.html
;;       A keyboard macro is represented as a string or vector, a lambda is a
;;       list with the symbol lambda as car.

;; TODO: Handle capitals and Shift just as well as any other mod

  "Alist of keys that always win the homogenizing battle.
Normally, the behavior of a chord-once sequence such as C-x¬†k¬†e
will be kept as is, and cloned to the perma-chord sequence
C-x¬†C-k¬†C-e, overwriting any binding there, so they both do what
the former always did.

If this list contains the member (\"C-x C-k C-e\"), the opposite
will happen in that particular case, overwriting C-x¬†k¬†e.

Each item in the list has the format (KEY-OR-COMMAND . KEYMAP).

KEY-OR-COMMAND can be either a `kbd'-compatible key description
or a symbol assumed to refer to a command.  In the event that two
items conflict, the first item wins.

Let's take an example.  Assume that
- C-x¬†f is bound to `set-fill-column',
- C-x¬†C-f is bound to `find-file',

and assume you add both (\"C-x¬†C-f\") and (set-fill-column) to
this list.  What happens? If (\"C-x¬†C-f\") came first, then both
C-x¬†f and C-x¬†C-f will be bound to `find-file'.
If (set-fill-column) came first, then both C-x¬†f and C-x¬†C-f will
be bound to `set-fill-column'.

Moving on.

If the optional cdr KEYMAP is left at nil, make KEY-OR-COMMAND
win in all keymaps in which it exists.  If non-nil, make it win
only inside KEYMAP.

KEYMAP should be a major or minor mode map.  It will likely have
no effect if it is a so-called named prefix-command such as
Control-X-prefix or kmacro-keymap (you can find these with
`describe-function', whereas you can't find org-mode-map, as
that's a proper mode map)."

  "Non-nil if homogenizing KEYDESC can cause bugs.
This has to do with e.g. C-x¬†\[ being duplicated to C-x¬†C-\[,
which is the same as C-x¬†ESC, which is the same as
C-x¬†M-anything.  You do this, then Magit tries to bind C-x¬†M-g
and complains it's not a prefix key and you can't even load
Magit.  That's a mild issue.  A more silent bug is C-x¬†i becoming
C-x¬†C-i which means it overrides your C-x¬†TAB binding, something
you're blissfully unaware of until you try to use C-x¬†TAB and
have no idea why it isn't bound to what you thought.

The root problem is anachronistic Unix control character
behavior, which Emacs has chosen not to deprecate, for the sake
of functioning inside basic terminal emulators, TTYs and ssh
connections.  We have a clean solution in
`massmapper-define-super-like-ctl' and never pressing the Control key
again in our lives.  Alternatively, we have an untested partial
solution in `massmapper-conserve-ret-and-tab'.

If you don't apply the solution, it pays to know this: always
bind the function key <tab> instead of the control character TAB,
<return> instead of RET, and <escape> instead of ESC.  GUI Emacs
always looks up the function key if bound, and only falls back to
the control character if the function key is unbound.  The
function keys may not work on the terminal/TTY, but neither do
Super, Hyper or many other niceties, and I recommend just using
chemacs to run a barebone Emacs for the odd time you're on the
TTY.

While it is possible to rescue C-i and C-m from the mummified
hands of Unix, you cannot ever use C-\[ as anything other than an
ESC shorthand.  As for C-g, the problem is only a hardcoded
default in Emacs, and I deem it's not fully fixable without a
patchset that lets you decide via \(say) a command-line flag
which key should act as keyboard-quitter instead of C-g.

To sum up, we return non-nil if the key sequence starts with
Control and involves any of \[, m, i, or g anywhere in the
sequence.  So we even count the sequence C-h¬†g as a nightmare
key: homogenizing it means binding C-h¬†C-g to the same, creating
a situation when C-g is not available for the usual
`abort-recursive-edit'."

  What this means is that we forbid any difference between
  \"similar\" key sequences such as C-x C-e and C-x e; we bind both
  to the same command, so it won‚Äôt matter if you keep holding down
  Control or not, after initiating that key sequence.

  The \"master copy\" is the one with fewer chords, i.e. C-x e,
  whose binding overrides the one on C-x C-e.  This can be
  customized on a case-by-case basis in `massmapper-homogenizing-winners'.

  Why we would do something so hare-brained?  It supports
  cross-training with the Deianira input paradigm, which by design
  cannot represent a difference between such key sequences.  Learn
