The long-absent Emacs facility to systematically remap key bindings.

Ever wished you could just "remap Control to Super", in a way that doesn't make things weird?  Then you're in luck, that's exactly the kind of thing we do here.

* Install

Requires Emacs 28+.

Not yet on (M)ELPA.  With [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] and =straight-enable-use-package-integration=, you can install the package like so:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package massmapper
  :straight (massmapper :type git :host github :repo "meedstrom/massmapper"))
#+end_src

Alternatively with Doom Emacs, this goes in =packages.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(package! massmapper :recipe (:host github :repo "meedstrom/massmapper"))
#+end_src

* Setup

To configure, add any of these hooks:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-meta)
#+end_src

and any of:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-alt-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-alt-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-alt-like-meta)
#+end_src

and any of:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-hyper-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-hyper-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-hyper-like-meta)
#+end_src

and any of (experimental):

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-metasuper-like-ctlmeta)
#+end_src

and finally, for those of you coming here from [[https://github.com/meedstrom/deianira][Deianira]], this is the great homogenizer and Raison D'Etre:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-homogenize-keymaps -50)
#+end_src

(More options to come)

Finally, turn it on by typing =M-x massmapper-mode RET=.

To see what has been remapped, try =M-x massmapper-list-remaps RET=.

If you're curious about inner workings, it may be nice to set =(setq massmapper-debug-level 1)= for a while.
