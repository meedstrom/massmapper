The long-absent Emacs facility to systematically remap key bindings.

To configure, add any of these hooks:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-super-like-meta)
#+end_src

and any of:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-alt-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-alt-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-alt-like-meta)
#+end_src

and any of:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-hyper-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-hyper-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-hyper-like-meta)
#+end_src

and any of (experimental):

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-define-metasuper-like-ctlmeta)
#+end_src

and, for those of you coming here from [[https://github.com/meedstrom/deianira][Deianira]], this is the great homogenizer:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmapper-keymap-found-hook #'massmapper-homogenize-keymaps -50)
#+end_src

(More options to come)

Finally, turn it on by typing =M-x massmapper-mode RET=.

To see what has been remapped, try =M-x massmapper-list-remaps RET=.  You can also debug further by evaluating =(setq massmapper-debug-level 2)=.
