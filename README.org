Fundamental setup (doesn't change your Emacs):

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'massmap)
(add-hook 'window-buffer-change-functions #'massmap-record-keymap-maybe -70)
#+end_src

Optional setup:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-homogenize-all-keymaps))
#+end_src

and any of these:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-super-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-super-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-super-like-meta)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-alt-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-alt-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-alt-like-meta)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-hyper-like-ctl)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-hyper-like-ctlmeta)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-hyper-like-meta)
(add-hook 'massmap-keymap-found-hook #'massmap-define-metasuper-like-ctlmeta)
#+end_src

Try also =M-x massmap-list-remaps RET= to see what has been remapped.  You can also try =(setq massmap-debug-level 2)=.
